ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tairan Yin

I am a PhD candidate from the RAINBOW team of INRIA, and an early stage researcher of *Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Innovation Training Network* as a part of the [CLIPE project](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/). My research interests covers Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, and Computer Animation. I am jointly supervised by Julien PettrÃ© and Marie-Paule Cani. My current research direction is **crowd simulation**. Specifically, I am exploiting the potential of Virtual Reality and Motion Capture for a better understanding of crowd behaviour and an easier generation of dynamic crowd scenes.
